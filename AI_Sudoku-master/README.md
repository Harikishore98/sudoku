GUI Smart Sudoku Solver that tries to extract a sudoku puzzle from a photo and solve it.

#### Convolutional Neural Network

* **Layers** A Convolution Layer, a Max Pooling layer flattened into a hidden layer followed by some Dropout Regularization, another hidden layer and finally the output layer. Each of the inner layer uses *ReLu* while the output layer uses *softmax*.
* **Compilation** *Adam* optimizer and *sparse categorical cross entropy* loss.
* **Training** The model is trained on the **MNIST** handwritten digits dataset which has around 70,000 28X28 images.
* **Accuracy** Around 98 percent accuracy on the test set.

#### K Nearest Neighbours
* **K** value used is 3.
* **Training** Trained on the **MNIST** handwritten digits dataset which has around 70,000 28X28 images.
* **Accuracy** Around 97 percent accuracy on the test set.
